# ArduinoMarsProject

## Project For Interaktive System, Saarland University.

### Project idea from ["The Martian"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k-GH3mbvUro&t=2s)
The basic project idea is to develop an Interacrive System that takes as an input Morse code (from a button), process with Arduino the Morse code into hexadecimal code that would be showed as an output throught a servo motor.

### Next steps:
- We are going to develop an input and output alternative for the project
- We are going to use Unity to increment the interaction with the system
- We are going to develop a wireless connection bewteen input and output system
